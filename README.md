# TERRAFORM
Access the game here: https://skyenxt.itch.io/terraform

## $ sudo ./terraform
[>_Ter]raform is a in-development retro-minimalistic platformer featuring an eventual twist on a bullet-hell style gameplay—instead of taking damage, bullets push you. The game has 2 modes: story mode and level select. Level select is unlocked after the completion of story mode—which isn't necessarily any easier! Completion of both involve the use of the terminal in the background. 



## $ sudo help
To figure out how to use the terminal, you can run help or sudo help for more detailed instructions. Here's the commands you may use:

sudo help — Displays this information in game.
sudo add --[type] [dx] [dy] — Creates [type] at <[dx], [dy]> from player.
sudo move [ID] [dx] [dy] — Moves entity with id [ID] a by <[dx], [dy]>.
sudo destroy [ID] — Destroys entity with id [ID].

The terminal will be introduced in the tutorial as well. Try to only use aspects of the game introduced when completing the tutorial—as the tutorial is meant for new players, trying to work around it may break the game. The assistant will walk you through the remainder of the controls. Here's a quick list:

Arrow keys to move/jump. Holding up arrow lets you jump higher.
Press Tab to dash.
Left shift at beginning to skip tutorial.
Left shift to spawn a temporary platform.     (STORY MODE ONLY, UNLOCKED IN PLOT)
X to destroy a nearby enemy-created entity.  (STORY MODE ONLY, UNLOCKED IN PLOT)
